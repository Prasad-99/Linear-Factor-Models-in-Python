## Performance Measurement

Risk_Factors.xlsx contains monthly observations of the risk-free rate and the three Fama–French risk factors (expressed as percentages, but without "%"), over the ten-year period from Jan 2004 through Dec 2013.

Using excess returns for the ten industry portfolios, calculate the following performance metrics:

    Sharpe ratio
    Sortino ratio (using risk-free rate as target)
    Treynor ratio (using CAPM β)
    Jensen's α
    Three-factor α

Create a table showing the performance metrics for the ten industry portfolios.
Plot your results as a bar chart for each performance metric.
Briefly explain the economic significance of each of the three performance ratios.
